## Personal Learning Objectives

- [x] learn how to debug on vscode
- [x] understand gem packages
- [x] learn the rspec one liner syntax
- [x] test-drive my code using the red-green-refactor cycle
- [x] use a methodical approach to solving problems
- [x] use my own initiative
- [x] define unit testing as the process of testing the smallest possible 'unit' of a programme.
- [x] understand each of the "3 As" of a unit test.
- [x] write some simple unit tests
- [x] identify errors and understand how to find the root cause
- [x] write methodical software - organised, clear and correct

## Things to celebrate

- [x] good health
- [x] catching up with friends after a long time
- [x] completing my first individual challenge
- [x] being present and really taking in the learnings from each workshop session
- [x] the weekly retrospective meeting with the cohort
- [x] learning how to plan before implementing code
- [x] being curious and dedicating extra time to cementing various concepts
- [x] keeping notes of my progress

## Emotions

_If you don't do the push up, you don't get the muscle._

I had the chance to attend a few pair-programming sessions with some cohort colleagues and apply the independent learning to a live project. The individual challenge which I am currently working on is also quite good as it brings my learning together and I am definitely able to pinpoint the things that have not quite settled or that I may need to practice more.

I've really enjoyed learning about rspec and its functionality. I now understand how to apply the principles of test driven development to a project. I think this enables devs to build clean, organised and methodical lines of code which are easy to read and debug. Although quite challenging, I did enjoy working with user stories and breaking those down into objects and methods that would later then drive the code implementation.

I feel a bit more settled into my learning journey. I appreciate the endless amount of resources available and I feel like I am definitely getting better by the day! I have started t have a more focused approach to studying and make use of my calendar to block time out for different tasks. My intention for the following week is to

## Progress and Learnings

> General learning

- learn to be specific in my google search
- make use of available resources
- structure my learning
- build a decision tree using user stories

> Test Driven Development

- test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
- RSpec use and best practices - Red Green Refactor method
- each test should make only one assertion
- learn how to create a directory and initialize rspec —init from the command line
- local, instance, class, global
- ruby class variables
- set up a simple project
- explain why a complete README is important
- initialise and push a git project
- give the structure of a User Story
- extract a Domain Model from User Stories
- define 'Feature Test' and use irb to implement
- explain how to use a stack trace to debug errors
- debug an error using a stack trace
- define RSpec as a testing framework
- describe an Object using a specification
- set up a Unit Test and implement the simplest code to make it pass
- move between Feature and Unit Tests
- test that an Object responds to a Message
- use RSpec 'predicate' syntax
- pass an instance as an argument
- set an attribute on an instantiated Object using an `@` instance variable
- use `attr_reader` to read an attribute on an instantiated Object
- use `fail` or `raise` to raise an error
- use a 'guard condition
- set an initial attribute value using initialize
- use the Single Responsibility Principle
- explain why doubles are needed to isolate unit tests
- use a double to isolate a unit test

> Debugging

- explain what a bug is
- explain a good approach to debugging
- follow an effective debugging process to identify a bug
- follow an effective debugging process to fix a bug

> Empathy

- ability to sense other's emotions and imagine what they might be thinking or feeling
- validation of others' emotions is so important

  _Three types of empathy_

  1. affective - feeling but without the drive to help
  2. empathetic concern - internalising emotions and driven to help or respond appropriately
  3. cognitive empathy- consciously imagining how someone is feeling without internalising

  _Tools_

  - 'Just like me' - Instead of defaulting to create measurements and separations, we attempt to find similarities. Humans are far more similar than different
  - Metta Bhavana - may you be happy
  - Empathy Active Listening - attention is a commodity; reflect back, ask more questions instead of responding, validate emotions, don't offer unsolicited advice, be present
  - Body → Heart → Head (settle body, self compassion, solution oriented)

  - [The 5 Dysfunctions of a Team](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Lencioni/dp/0787960756)

> Pair programming

- learning more as you have to explain the code
- idea generation
- spread knowledge - new programming language, new development environment, new techniques, short cuts TDD
- communication skills
- better software through faster feedback
