## My Why

My interest in tech started with learning about the many amazing and inspiring females already powering the industry. I aspire to make a change through my work and similarly, I wish for my work to challenge and change me! One thing that stuck with me from the very beginning of my coding journey is the wide support network available to software engineers. I find that impressive and unparalleled amongst other industries I have worked in.

My vision for my career progression is towards UI engineering, helping create innovative solutions that change the way in which users interact with technologies, specifically assistive technologies.
