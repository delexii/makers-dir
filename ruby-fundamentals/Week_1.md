## Emotions

This first week was an emotional ride for me. Having just landed back in the UK from an incredible and very intense month abroad working on the Paralympic Games in Tokyo, I felt completely overwhelmed on my first day of the Bootcamp. From readjusting to my home environment and a routine, to coming to grips with the course curriculum and the realisation that I am finally living a big dream of mine, this first week felt relentless. I continued to push through and believe that I am strong enough to do it all, despite my mind/body being under a lot of pressure. I ended up having a burnout, sleeping 16 hours straight after coming down with high fever and feeling unwell. This taught me a very important lesson on allowing myself to have breaks and being more strategic with my time.

Nonetheless, I am very happy with my progress so far. I was able to navigate the materials and catch up on the workload before the end of the week, which was one of my goals for the week. I am excited to meet even more of my peers during the daily check-in sessions and pair programming next week, and continue to build on my desired skills.

## Key Learnings

> **General**

- Ask questions where uncertain - cohorts that learn together, succeed together!
- Digest big problems into smaller ones - easier to solve
- Rubber ducking - learning how to explain code
- memory address and binary/decimal number systems

> **Command Line**

- create, move, remove files and directories
- navigate between directories using tab
- set environment variables
- both cat and echo can add text to new files; cat also used to combine text documents and view text files in the terminal
- run rspec and rb files from the command line

> **Version Control**

- Git - version control system
- understand and use basic commands `init`, `clone`, `pull`, `push`, `add`, `commit`, `status`, `log`, `merge`, `remove`
- understand the difference between forking and cloning repositories
- use GitHub which is the web interface of git
- understand git workflow
- SSH/ HTTPS authentication methods

> **Ruby fundamentals**

- use of interactive ruby irb to test code in real time (user becomes part of the programme world)
- how to run a procedure in the terminal: `ruby fileName.rb` from the **correct** **directory**
- assigning names to objects (variables)
- send messages or call methods on objects using the .dot syntax
- use referential transparency and flowcharts to break down code lines and understand the logic better
- flow of control = the order in which an object executes a set of instructions
- conditional procedures - can use comparison or logical operations
- loops and the use of accumulators
- main differences between `puts`, `print` and `p`
- classes and their instances (`.new` to instantiate an object)
