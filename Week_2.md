## Emotions

I feel more positive at the end of this week. I have worked really hard to stay on track with my learning, especially after undergoing surgery on Thursday. What has helped me find the motivation to keep showing up for myself every day was knowing that now I have all the support and resources needed to be successful and it is all up to me to make it happen! I am deeply grateful every day to be able to learn how to code and be part of such an amazing group of junior devs!

While I feel like I've achieved my goals this past week, there are still times where I experience self doubt. What I started doing in order to keep myself on a progressive line and maintain a positive mindset is to celebrate one thing I have learned at the end of each day. I have also come to the conclusion that spending less time, but more focused, is better than spending hours on end without a structure or control flow.

_Stop doing_

→ comparing my progress to other people
→ be afraid to ask questions or support
→ struggle in silence

_Keep doing_

→ daily code challenges
→ daily reflection and appreciation of my learnings
→ stay curious

## Key Learnings

> **General**

- complete all 10 quizzes and successfully applied the process of algorithmic thinking
- use map v each methods on arrays
- learn about combination, repeated combination, permutation, repeated permutation
- Data Encapsulation - allowing data hiding, reusability of code
- Data Abstraction - helps increase the security of a system because only crucial details are made available to the user.
- Polymorphism - allowing access of same methods across various objects of the c
- Inheritance - a relation between two classes which allows the classes lower down in hierarchy to get the features or methods of those higher up (parent classes)
- more kata practice!
- portfolio preparation for apprenticeship end review - how am I doing something and why?

> **Ruby fundamentals (cont'd)**

- write programs using conditionals and loops
- write programs using arrays and hashes
- create own methods and classes
- learn how to create instances and instance variables. Instance variables cannot be seen outside of the scope of their assignment
- learn main methods that can be called on strings, arrays, hashes
- understand the Single Responsibility Principle (methods should do one thing only and do it well)
- understand the difference between imperative and declarative programming
- know how to implement a process from planning a solution, to breaking the problem down into smaller steps to executing and testing the code

> **EQ Workshop Learnings**

- Learn about feedback and conflict resolution
- Acknowledge my own fear of confrontation, fight or flight approaches
- There are six core needs we seek to satisfy - love, significance in the eyes of others, certainty, variety or stimulation, growth and being of service to others or having a higher purpose.
- Learn about blind spots - traits or behaviours that others can see and we don't in ourselves
- Build resilience and identify my own recovery stages after feedback or negative event (hold space for myself)
- Types of feedback - appreciation, evaluation, coaching.
- Learn about door mat vs. sword vs. lantern approach! I am trying to move from a sword approach, in the sense of standing my ground and being a bit more on the assertive end of the spectrum, to a lantern behaviour. Looking to clarify and bring light to different situations.
- Vulnerability and courage - leadership skills

  How do we make giving and receiving feedback easier?

  1. Shift your perspective - you choose your reaction and boundaries, become an empowered receiver that can apply the lantern approach
  2. Know thyself - truth, relationship, identity triggers
  3. Understand feedback
  4. Use a framework (ASK)
